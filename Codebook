The final tidy data set produced by the R script 'run_analysis.R' is a text file containing 11880 observations of 4 variables. Each of these variables is described below, along with the variable type, short description, and general dimensions.

subject
numeric
unique number assigned to each subject in the study
1	values 1:30 

Note: In the original data sets, the subject values were recorded in text files ‘subject_test.txt’ and ‘subject_train.txt’.

activity
string
unique activity engaged in by each subject
factor w/ 6 levels
1	WALKING
2	WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3	WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4	SITTING
5	STANDING
6	LAYING

Note: In the original data sets, the activity values were recorded in text files ‘y_test.txt’ and ‘y_train.txt’.

Note: In the original data sets, 561 measurement labels were recorded in a text file ‘features.txt’ and comprised differing results of mathematical operations carried out on the original inertial readings taken from smartphones used in the study. For the purpose of this project, only the mean and standard deviation values were extracted.

measurementMean
numeric
mean of each measurement, for each activity, for each subject.
values -0.99770: 0.97450

Note: In the original data sets, the measurements were stored in two text files ‘X_test.txt’ and ‘X_train.txt’ comprising several thousand observations of the 561 variables noted. These were joined for this project to produce a single table for further analysis.
